Phrodo\_00's dotfiles
=====================

Basic configuration files. Install with:

```bash
bash install
```

The install script uses dotbot to keep everything nice and tidy :simple_smile:.

This only installs vim/neovim configs and plugin manager. To finish the vim
configuration you need to install the plugins by starting vim and running:

```viml
:PlugInstall
```
